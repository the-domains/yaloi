Two Shops
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e3244383-0499-4a80-b01b-2577a5432200.jpg)

There are two drycleaning shops at walking distance from our home in Brussels. But I find choosing between them very hard.

Drycleaning shop A is run by an extremely friendly lady, who offers a wide smile whenever I enter her shop, greeting me as if a long-time friend is walking in. She remembers my name and offers a warm "see you soon" after I dropped my my clothes. The problem is, the shop is almost always closed. I cannot even count on two hands the number of times I stood there, with a bag of shirts and jeans, looking at the "sorry, we're closed" sign. They're closed on Monday mornings, Wednesday afternoons, Friday evenings, Christian holidays, Muslim holidays, Hindu holidays, full moons, new moons, summer solstices, and most of the other working days in between.

That's why I most often visit drycleaning shop B. It is run by a lady who hasn't smiled since 1983, when she heard the end of the world would be within three weeks. It never happened, and ever since then she inflicts her disappointment with her customers. There's no smile, no friendliness, only a lukewarm hello or goodbye, when she's in a festive mood, and I have told her my name a hundred times. However, her shop is open. Unlike drycleaner A, where I had the pleasure of being served only a handful of times, I can only really rely in drycleaner B. I don't get a smile, but at least I get service.

I wondered, maybe lady A is so happy because she rarely works. Maybe lady B is unfriendly because the shop is always open.

Some people claim the purpose of the business is to delight the customer, others say that employees always come first. But I'm not so sure about either. What if we can agree on a compromise, where I'm serviced most of the time (but not always) by an employee with a friendly smile (without overdoing it).

That would be nice.
